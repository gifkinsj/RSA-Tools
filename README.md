## Out-RSATokenBatchCSV.ps1 
This script is used to create a CSV for bulk creating users and assigning tokens to those users using the AMBulKAdmin library

Future Improvements:
Fix the progress bar so it indicates a duration of time
Error handling
Input sanitization (preventing infinite loops on the first and last number entries)
