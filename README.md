# RSA Tools
This repo contains various tools to assist with administrating RSA Authentication Manager systems.

## Out-RSATokenBatchCSV.ps1 
This script is used to create a CSV for bulk creating users and assigning tokens to those users using the AMBA (Authentication Manager Bulk Admin) library


### Future Improvements
1. Fix the progress bar so it indicates a duration of time
2. Error handling
3. Input sanitization (preventing infinite loops on the first and last number entries)
